We provide: 

-raw data(alanine and glycerol media) for E.coli cell length growth trajectories. Time is in hours, legnth in microns.   

-reproducable codes for fitting proposed growth models to the data and to recreate figures in the text.   

-spreadsheets of fitted parameters for each model to the cells in the alanine data
